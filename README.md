# FriendFinder

The Seinfeld Character Finder is a survey that compares your answers to the answers that the characters of Seinfeld submitted! After you have submitted your answers, you will then be added to the site's API for comparisons! Using HTML and CSS for design, Node and Express for server creating, and Heroku for hosting, this web app is simple for the user, but was a bit challenging in development.
